Get Ι’11 up ›to them: O, our Chremes,

Chr. Your Servant, Geta. “ ²
Get. I’rn glad to see you safe return ’.d ’
Chr. I believe it.

Get. How goes all?

Chr. Pretty much hurried, as is usual at one’ s first coming home:
butI have heard a great deal of News fince my Arrival.

tht. No doubt: Have you been told what has happen 'd to Ani?
θ ⁴ ,μμ
p Chr. All.. ’

Get. What, did you tell him of it? (to Demipho.) ’Tis a mon·
'strous thing, Chremes, to be circumvented in this manner.

Chr 1 was talking with him about it just now.
-. Get. Nay‚ and Ι t00, revolving it anxioussy ln my own Mind,
flatter myself I have found out a Remedy for this Evil.

Dem. How, Geta3 What Remedy. Ρ ·

Get. As I went from you, by chance Phormio met me. ι ¹
Chr. What Phormio. 9

Get. He that patronizes the young Woman. . ”
Chr. I understand. ·

⁷ Get. It came into my Head to found him a little: Ι took him afide:
Phormio, said 'I, why don' t you endeavour to make an End of this
Affair, rather by fair means than foul? My Master' ιε genereus, and
·hates Law- Suits: for I affure you all the rest of his Friends, with
one Voice, counsell’ d him to turn her out of Doors direffly.

- Ant. (tohzmfilf) What is he about, or where w111 this end at last? ·

Get. You ll lay, perhaps, that the Law will puniffi him, i'f he
turns her out. That Affair has been already canvass’ d. Let me tell
you, you 11 have enough to do, if once you engage with him, he

can speak well. But suppose you cast him, 'tis not a Matter of Life
and Death; but a mere Money Bufiness. .When Ι found that thale
words h'ad sunl< a little the Gentlema'n' s Courage, We are now
here by ourselves‚ said 1: come, tell me wh'at would you demand now

to drop this Suit with my Master, td rid u's of'fhis Girl, and trouble .
us no more. Ρ - , Ant.
